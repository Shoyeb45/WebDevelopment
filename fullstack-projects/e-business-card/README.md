## 💼 **Main Goal**
Build an **e-business card** web application using **React**. The app allows users (or an admin) to create, view, update, and delete business card-like profiles of people.

## ✅ **Features Breakdown**

### 🔹 1. **Reusable Card Component**

You need to create a **React component** called `Card` (or similar) that displays a person's professional info in a nice layout. It should accept **props** so it can be reused for any person.

#### The Card should display:
- **Name**: A string (e.g., "John Doe").
- **Short Description**: A brief summary of the person, like "Full Stack Developer" or "UI/UX Enthusiast".
- **Social Media Buttons**: Clickable icons or buttons for platforms like:
  - LinkedIn
  - Twitter
  - GitHub, Instagram, etc. (You can choose)
- **Interests**: A list or tags (like “AI”, “Open Source”, “Gaming”).

🎨 **Creativity encouraged**: You can use icons, hover effects, colors, and animations to make it look polished.

### 🔹 2. **Input Page for Creating Cards**

This is a separate page or form in the frontend where users can fill in the following details:
- Name
- Description
- Social media links
- Interests (maybe as comma-separated input)

When the form is submitted:
- A new Card is created and displayed on the frontend.
- The data is also sent to the backend (stored in the database).

---

### 🔹 3. **Backend Server with Database (CRUD Support)**

You will create a simple **backend server** (Node.js + Express is common) that connects to a database (MongoDB or SQL).

#### The backend must support:
- **Create** a card (when a new one is submitted)
- **Read** all cards (when frontend loads or refreshes)
- **Update** a card (maybe by ID)
- **Delete** a card

Each card’s data is stored in the DB, and the server provides **REST API endpoints** like:
- `GET /cards` → Get all cards
- `POST /cards` → Add a new card
- `PUT /cards/:id` → Update a specific card
- `DELETE /cards/:id` → Remove a specific card

---

### 🔹 4. **Frontend CRUD Operations (Admin Feature)**

From the frontend:
- You should be able to **view all cards** (retrieved from the backend).
- If you're the **admin** (you can hardcode this check or use a login):
  - **Add** a new card
  - **Edit** existing cards
  - **Delete** cards

This means the frontend will call the backend APIs based on user interaction.

## 🧠 Tech Stack Suggestions

- **Frontend**: React + Axios + TailwindCSS/Bootstrap (for design)
- **Backend**: Node.js + Express
- **Database**: MongoDB or PostgreSQL (MongoDB works well with JSON-like data)

## 📝 Example Flow

1. **User visits the site**.
2. The site shows all existing Cards (fetched from backend).
3. Admin logs in (or is identified).
4. Admin clicks “Add New Card”.
5. A form appears — they input the details and submit.
6. The card appears on the page and is saved in the database.
7. Admin can click “Edit” or “Delete” on each card.
8. All data persists via the backend.
