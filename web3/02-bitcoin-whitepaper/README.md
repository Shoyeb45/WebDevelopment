<!--THE END-->

- **Purpose**: Introduces a decentralized digital currency system, eliminating the need for intermediaries like banks.

<!--THE END-->

- **Problem Crux**: Double spending in digital currencies, where a single digital token could be spent more than once.

#### **Concept of an Electronic Coin**

- **Definition**: An electronic coin in Bitcoin is defined as a chain of digital signatures. This chain represents the ownership history of the coin, tracking each time it changes hands.

#### **How Ownership is Transferred**

- **Transaction Structure**:
  
  - Each time a coin is transferred, the current owner signs a digital hash of the previous transaction.
  - The hash includes:
    
    1. **The Previous Transaction**: Proof of how the current owner acquired the coin.
      
      
    2. **The Public Key of the Next Owner**: Designates the new owner of the coin.

<!--THE END-->

- **Digital Signatures**:
  
  - The current owner uses their private key to create a digital signature, adding it to the end of the coinâ€™s chain and effectively transferring ownership.
  - **Hash of the Transaction**: A unique string generated from the transaction data, ensuring even a small change produces a completely different hash.
  - **Public Key of the Next Owner**: Serves as the address to which the coin is sent; only the holder of the corresponding private key can access and spend the coin.

#### **Verification of Ownership**

- **Verification Process**:
  
  - The payee can verify the transactionâ€™s authenticity by checking the chain of digital signatures.
  - This involves:
    
    1. **Verifying the Signatures**: Ensuring each signature in the chain is legitimate by checking against the corresponding public key.
      
      <!--THE END-->
      
    2. **Verifying the Chain of Ownership**: Tracing back the chain of transactions to confirm that the coinâ€™s ownership has been validly transferred.

#### **Chain of Ownership**

- **Purpose**: The chain of digital signatures serves as a record of ownership, proving that the current owner has legitimately acquired the coin.

<!--THE END-->

- **Security**: Ensures that the ownership of the coin is secure and can be verified without relying on a central authority.

## **Digital Signatures**

- **Partial Solution**: Digital signatures ensure the authenticity and integrity of a transaction. While crucial for securing transactions, they do not fully solve the double-spending problem.

<!--THE END-->

- **Double-Spending Problem**: Refers to the risk of a single digital token being spent more than once, an issue arising from the ease of copying digital information.

<!--THE END-->

- Transactions are secured with digital signatures.

<!--THE END-->

- Each Bitcoin user has a pair of cryptographic keys: a public key and a private key.

<!--THE END-->

- The private key signs transactions, ensuring only the owner can spend their Bitcoins.

## **Peer-to-Peer Network and Proof-of-Work (PoW)**

- **Proposed Solution**: Solving the double-spending problem using a peer-to-peer (P2P) network. The networkâ€™s key innovation is the proof-of-work mechanism.

<!--THE END-->

- **Network Operation**: Nodes in the network validate and relay transactions.

<!--THE END-->

- **Timestamps and Hashing**:
  
  - Each transaction is timestamped and hashed into a chain (the blockchain).
  - The chain is secured through proof-of-work, where nodes (miners) expend computational power to solve cryptographic puzzles.

<!--THE END-->

- **Immutable Record**:
  
  - The blockchain forms an ongoing, immutable record of transactions.
  - Once a block is added to the chain, it cannot be altered without redoing the proof-of-work for that block and all subsequent blocks.

<!--THE END-->

- **Mining Process**: Nodes (miners) solve complex mathematical problems to validate transactions and add them to the blockchain.

<!--THE END-->

- **Rewards**: The first miner to solve the problem gets to add a new block and is rewarded with newly minted Bitcoins.

### **What is Proof-of-Work?**

- **Concept**: Proof-of-work is a cryptographic mechanism where participants (miners) must perform computational work to solve a problem. In Bitcoin, this problem involves finding a value that, when hashed using a cryptographic hash function like SHA-256, produces a hash with a certain number of leading zero bits.

<!--THE END-->

- **Origin**: The PoW system used in Bitcoin is similar to the one proposed by Adam Back in [Hashcash](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hashcash), originally designed to combat email spam by requiring senders to perform a small amount of computational work.

### **How Proof-of-Work Works**

- **Hash Function**: Bitcoin uses the SHA-256 hash function, which takes an input and produces a fixed-size output (the hash). The goal is to find an input (a block of transactions) that produces a hash beginning with a specific number of zero bits.

<!--THE END-->

- **Difficulty**: The number of leading zero bits required in the hash determines the difficulty of the proof-of-work. The more zero bits required, the harder it is to find such a hash. The difficulty is set to maintain a consistent average time to find a solution across the network.

## **Longest Chain Rule**

- **Chain Validity**:
  
  - The longest chain in the blockchain is considered valid because it represents the most computational work (CPU power) invested.
  - This chain serves as proof of the sequence of events (transactions) and indicates that it was generated by the majority of the networkâ€™s computing power.

<!--THE END-->

- **Security Assumption**:
  
  - The network's security relies on the assumption that a majority of CPU power is controlled by honest nodes.
  - As long as this is true, the honest nodes will always generate the longest chain, outpacing any attackers.

<!--THE END-->

- Once a transaction is confirmed and added to the blockchain, it cannot be altered.

## **Network Structure and Operation**

- **Minimal Structure**:
  
  - The network is designed to operate with minimal structure.
  - Nodes do not need to follow strict protocols or maintain constant connectivity.

<!--THE END-->

- **Broadcasting and Rejoining**:
  
  - Transactions and blocks are broadcasted to the network on a best-effort basis.
  - Nodes can leave and rejoin the network at will. When they rejoin, they accept the longest proof-of-work chain as the authoritative record of transactions.

<!--THE END-->

- **Resilience and Flexibility**: This decentralized approach ensures the networkâ€™s resilience and flexibility, allowing it to continue operating even if some nodes go offline or the network is under attack.

<!--THE END-->

- **Incentives and Mining**:
  
  - Miners are incentivized to secure the network through block rewards and transaction fees.
  - As more miners join, the difficulty of the mathematical problems increases, maintaining a steady block generation rate.

<!--THE END-->

- **Limited Supply**:
  
  - Bitcoin has a fixed supply of 21 million coins, designed to create scarcity and mimic precious metals like gold.
  - The block reward halves approximately every four years in an event known as "halving."

<!--THE END-->

- **Decentralized Ledger (Blockchain)**:
  
  - Transactions are grouped into blocks and linked together to form a blockchain.
  - The blockchain is a public ledger, visible to all participants in the network.
  - Each block contains a list of validated transactions and a reference (hash) to the previous block, ensuring immutability.

<!--THE END-->

- **Security and Attacks**:
  
  - The network is secure as long as honest nodes control more CPU power than any attacking group.
  - Discusses the "51% attack" scenario, where a malicious actor with more than 50% of the network's hashing power could potentially alter the blockchain.

## **Applications and Implications**

- **Decentralization**: Bitcoinâ€™s model removes the need for centralized financial institutions.

<!--THE END-->

- **Trust**: Users do not need to trust a third party; trust is placed in cryptography and the network itself.

<!--THE END-->

- **Global Currency**: Bitcoin can be used globally without restrictions, offering an alternative to traditional currencies.

<!--THE END-->

- **Future of Finance**: Paved the way for the development of other cryptocurrencies and the broader decentralized finance (DeFi) ecosystem.
